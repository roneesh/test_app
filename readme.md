# Test App

## Installation

1. Run 'npm install'
2. Run 'npm start' to start the app
3. Change the port number in js/index.js if you're already using 3000.

## Architecture

The application uses HTML5Boilerplate as a skeleton for folder structure, and to import some general best practices in HTML/CSS development. Such as warning the user in older browsers, meta tags to make responsive display in an iPhone and using a CSS Normalize.

The application uses Express.js to serve the app and give it routing.
